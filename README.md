Simple equation solver
======================

The EquationSystem class present in `lib/equation_system.rb` is able to solve a system of n first-degree equations with n unknown variables.

Requirements:

-   The equations may only contain variables with coefficients (eg. 4z) and numbers.
-   All numbers should be rational, written with decimal-notation.
-   The only allowed operators are plus and minus (except the hidden multiplication sign between the coefficient and the variable).
